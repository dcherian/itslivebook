# To do for this book

- have been changing structure around a lot, need to change certain older nb pages to reflect that
    - data and software page needs to be modified
        "two data streams" section isn't really accurate anymore
    - individual glacier workflow pages can be trimmed down to remove data access sections, just focus on xr workflows
    - regional workflow page needs to be changed a lot
    
    ## Final structure:
    1. Intro
        -background, learning goals
    2. Software and data
        - software section needs to be updated
        - conda env info?
        - describe the data that will be used here, 
        - data access options
            - something like we show 2 data access options, netcdf thru NSDIC interface, zarr thru s3 buckets
    3. s3 access nb
    4. individual glacier analysis 1 (full glacier)
    5. individual glacier analysis 2 (centerline)
    6. regional glacier analysis
