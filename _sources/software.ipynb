    "This notebook is going to contain an example of something you might run into: the same (or similar) data is hosted from different sources, meaning it is accessed in different ways and may be in slightly different formats. In this case, we have ITS_LIVE velocity data that can be accessed from an S3 bucket and from the NSIDC DAAC. You'll see that while this is the same underlying dataset, the formatting varies significantly between the two and in this case, the data are in two different file types (Geotiff and netcdf). In the [Tutorial content](new_velocity_data.ipynb) page, you will see sections on ingesting and working with both types of data. "
