# Introduction

In this notebook, we'll go over steps to access glacier surface velocity data, organize it into a format that's easier to work with, and then calculate mean velocities for individual glaciers within a region.

***Learning objectives**: download data, read into jupyter notebook using xarray, basic manipulation and organizing using xarray, computations with xarray objects, aggregating using xarray groupby, xarray to pandas, working with raster and vector data*

Navigate to the other pages in this jupyter book to find out more about this tutorial. You can check out the data and open source python tools we'll be using before we get started with the notebook.
