    "This notebook is going to contain an example of something you might run into: the same (or similar) data is hosted from different sources, meaning it is accessed in different ways and may be in slightly different formats. In this case, we have ITS_LIVE velocity data that can be accessed from an S3 bucket as **zarr datacubes** from the NSIDC DAAC as **netcdfs** and from the NSIDC DAAC (??) as **geotiffs**. You'll see that while this is the same underlying dataset, the formatting varies significantly among the three and in this case, the data are in different file types. \n",

    "In [Accessing ITS_LIVE zarr datacubes](accessing_s3_data.ipynb) you will see an example of accessing cloud-hosted zarr datacubes that are stored in s3 bukets hosted by Amazon Web Services. In the [Regional glacier velocity analysis notebook](region_scale_glacier_analysis.ipynb), you will see how to construct xarray objects representing glacier velocity data from **geotiff** files. Finally, in the [individual glacier analysis 1 notebook](individual_glacier_analysis1.ipynb) you will see an example of dowloading and reading ITS_LIVE data in netcdf-format accessed from the NSIDC DAAC.
